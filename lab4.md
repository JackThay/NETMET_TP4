### What kind of information do you retrieve by pinging an IP address from a single VP?

We get a Reachability, Round-Trip Time (RTT), Packet Loss, TTL (Time to Live) IP Address Resolution or Error Messages

### Describe how we can extract a geographical distance from a ping between a VP and an IP address

By using the RTT from the ping and 2/3 of the speed of light, we can calculate a perimeter around the vantage point where the target IP adress might be.

### You made your measurements and issued a ping toward the target from a set of VPs. Which one is giving you the most precise estimation of the targetâ€™s geolocation?

The one with the shortest RTT

None, we use ALL the perimeters of our VP to get some common area between all perimeters.
We can then estimate a more accurate area where the target might be by using that shared area from all the VP and their perimeters.

### Can you think about a way to use multiple distance information to estimate the geolocation of the IP address? (Hints: think about how GPS work)
